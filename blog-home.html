                <h4>March 1, 2017</h4>
                <p class="post-body post-intro">Alison graduated Duke in 2011 as an English major and [Executive] Vice President of BOW. She worked at Deutsche Bank in London where she focused on Corporate Social Responsibility efforts and then moved to New York to work in Nomura on Leadership Development and Diversity & Inclusion. She is currently pursuing an MBA at Imperial College Business School in London, planning on returning to financial services in London after graduating.</p> 
                <p class="post-body question">Thinking back, what led you to join BOW?</p>
                <p class="post-body">Since I was little I wanted to go into business for some reason but I didn't know what -- I just knew that I wanted to be in that environment. I didn't want to be a doctor or be a ballerina or anything else. I thought that BOW would be a great way to get into a group of people that could teach me about the different roles that I could potentially pursue in the business world and [it] was really helpful to hear from the senior women and speakers that we brought in about what you do day to day in different industries.
                <p class="post-body question">How did you end up in London?
                <p class="post-body">When I was a senior, I was looking at different jobs in marketing and advertising and then by chance I came across this internship program that basically puts you working at a financial services firm in London for a year. And I thought, Oh my gosh, I really loved London and I'm hitting a bit of a lull with my marketing career, so why don't I just take this opportunity and get into a good firm for a year and get international experience.
                <p class="post-body question">What was your experience like working there?
                <p class="post-body">I liked the environment, I liked the energy of the pace, and the people around me were very nice and very smart and ambitious, so I liked that a lot but I was in a role that was also a good fit for my personality; it was coordinating events, it was marketing and communications and a lot of interpersonal skills, and I was leading committees who plan these events and managing relationships externally and internally.
                <p class="post-body question">What was the hardest part about moving abroad?
                <p class="post-body">I think it's just getting comfortable being completely alone moving to these global cities. I think it's very challenging--you move to one thing and you don't know anyone and you have to really be scrappy and fight for what you want.I had to ask [for new a role at work], it didn't really land in my lap, I had to fight for it and then do some Ops work on the side while I was doing the events planning work and try to make friends on the side and have a balanced life.
                <p class="post-body question">What's something interesting that you've learned along the way?
                <p class="post-body">I think in all of the experiences I learned kind of how to work effectively with global teams. And I think that's a valuable skill because cultures are very different depending on who you're working with. It's a little difficult, but you do have to learn how to be yourself and let your personality shine through while also have the cultural norms in mind when you're interacting with groups across the world.
                <p class="post-body question">What's your advice for those looking to work abroad?
                <p class="post-body">My biggest advice is to get into a global company that has the ability to transfer people. So if you get your feet on the ground in the U.S. and figure out you want that international experience, they might be willing to switch you over internally and that is the easiest way to move around internationally.
                <p class="post-body question">What led you to pursue an MBA?
                <p class="post-body">So, I decided to get an MBA primarily because I really wanted to come back to London and land full-time work here. Once I got to New York I realized that London was just a better fit for me as a city. And so I thought, you know what, maybe getting an MBA will help me get a visa sponsorship from a company who's recruiting me in London and it will be easier to network with people on the ground. And, as a bonus as well, it really broadens out your background academically.
                <p class="post-body question">What was your favorite accomplishment while at Duke?
                <p class="post-body">While at Duke, I learned pretty quickly that I wanted my focus to be extra-curricular committees and to really get involved in campus culture and end up meeting companies by the time I was a senior. So, I had four different leadership positions of different organizations, so being the [Executive] Vice President of BOW, and then the other big one that took up a lot of my time was Duke University Union. There were 8 of us in the committee, and just learning how to motivate people, how to have fun but also get the work done and coordinate all these different details that go together to create a successful event were skills that I ended up using in my first job.</p>
